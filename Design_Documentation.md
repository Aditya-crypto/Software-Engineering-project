GOALS:

a) The main objective of the software is to prevent social gathering of people above a certain threshold value by capturing images of different street locations with the help of webcams deployed in those areas.

b) The webcams will be distributed across the city and will be connected to a server monitoring the images captured by the webcams.

c) The servers will hold a database which will store an id corresponding to each webcam,location of the webcam ,image obtained from the webcam(in the form of pixels) and time at the image was captured.

d) The image obtained from the webcams will be proposed with the help of machine learning algorithms and the number of people at any time at any location will be obtained.

e) The server will also store data involving servers corresponding to nearest police stations.

f) If the image obtained from any particular webcam involves huge crowding of people then the server will locate the nearest police station .

h) An alert message will be generated and the time and location of the corresponding webcam will be sent to the server of the nearest police station so that necessary actions can be taken on time.

i) There will be multiple such interconnected servers for each every 10 to 15 webcams.
