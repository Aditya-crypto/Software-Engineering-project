Overview :

We are in a situation of Corona - Virus(COVID -19) pandemic. The government has declared a lockdown pan India in order to prevent people
from gathering at a place, which prevents the virus to spread amongst them, thus enforcing Social Distancing. Still it is observed on a 
daily basis that, for some reasons, people are violating this lockdown and gathering at places outside their homes. This may have severe 
effects and will definitely increase the spread of the virus.

India being a large country, it is sometimes difficult for local police stations to monitor and efficiently manage each and every area
under their jurisdiction, simultaneously.We have limited police force and with such population it is often difficult for the police to 
control the situation.Thus, we need a system, which will help them in managing this lockdown.This is the motivation behind developing 
our software.

The motivation of our software is to inform the police about such social gatherings so that they can take strict actions and help to 
avoid the transmission of COVID-19. The advantage of this system is that it helps the local police stations  to have an overall view 
of the town by just getting alert images, this way they don't have to waste their time in patrolling all the time around the city.

The overall idea is to develop a distributed system in which initially we take images from each camera located on various streets,
then using Machine learning algorithms identify the number of people in the image and if the number is greater than a particular set 
threshold, it sends an alert with time and location to the nearest police station. This is the main objective behind our software..Thus, reducing the overall effort of local police 
stations and providing current updates about the situations in the city.
